# Movie_Trailer_Project
A simple movie trailer website project for Udacity's full-stack nanodegree program. The project demonstrates the use of a 
Movie object class in Python to generate a static webpage, which displays a listing of favorite movies and links each movie to 
its trailers video on YouTube. The project also includes some CSS and jQuery involved in the display of the webpage.
After downloading the project files, a movie trailer page can be created by importing media.py and fresh_tomatoes.py at the 
start of your Python script. Then create idividual Movie objects by calling media.Movie() and supplying it with four arguments 
-- title, year, poster_url, and trailer_url. Lastly, to generate the movie trailers page, call fresh_tomatoes.open_movies_page()
